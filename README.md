## Follow Up Question

If given more time, how would you improve the quality of your application? Would you implement anything differently? Please provide your comments in the README.

- Implement lazy loading or pagination when there the dataset grows
- The data transform algorithm is not scalable because the it loops through the data multiple times. So if given more time and control on the data structure, the algorithm need to be improved
- Add unit test
- More design for Loading and Error components
- Error boundary for handling global error state
